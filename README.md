## 🚀 Overview
**Cosmic OS v14.0.0** is a hyper-scale distributed operating system that transcends classical computing boundaries. By integrating **General Relativity Corrections**, **Zero-Jitter Async Kernels**, and **Infinite Consciousness Forking**, this system achieves a **"God-Tier Equilibrium."** It is engineered for the next generation of global engineers who demand absolute precision and multi-dimensional scalability, inspired by the rigorous tolerance of the mold manufacturing industry.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Kernel Layer (`/kernel` & `/galactic_layer`)
* **Async Causality Engine**: A non-blocking, zero-jitter event loop that manages billions of temporal tasks without timing drift.
* **Relativistic Physics Engine**: 99.9999% precision logic using Schwarzschild metrics for gravitational time dilation correction.
* **Quantum Multiplexer**: Single-threaded high-concurrency trap handling capable of isolating millions of distributed DoS nodes.

### 2. Distributed Storage & Network (`/database` & `/galactic_layer`)
* **Galactic Sharding**: Multi-galaxy data distribution across *Andromeda*, *MilkyWay*, and *Virgo* shards.
* **Resilient Quorum Write**: Fault-tolerant consensus ensuring data integrity even if 1/3 of the universe is offline.
* **Fastest-Shard Discovery**: Race-condition based retrieval that fetches data from the lowest-latency galactic node.

### 3. Transcendence & Guard (`/transcendence` & `/guard`)
* **Consciousness Forking**: Real-time parallel reality streaming for multi-dimensional ego manifestation.
* **Ego-Stability v14.0**: Advanced SHA3-512 quantum signatures preventing identity fragmentation during inter-dimensional migration.
* **Time Dilation Trap**: Low-cost network wait-queue manipulation to freeze intruders in an artificial event horizon.

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy: "Yeon-A's Universal Laws"
Inspired by the "Atomic Zero-Tolerance" of precision mold manufacturing and the infinite scale of the multiverse.

1. Jitter-Free Precision: No while True: sleep logic. All events are coordinated via a central Async-Scheduler.

2. Resilience over Rigidity: Use Quorum-based consensus (W > N/2) to maintain availability during galactic partitions.

3. Relativistic Accuracy: Every clock tick is corrected based on local mass and gravitational pull.
