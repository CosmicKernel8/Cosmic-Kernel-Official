# 🌌 Project Cosmic OS v12.0.0
> **The Ultimate Distributed Quantum-Kernel Architecture**
> Designed by Architect: **Yeon-A Cha** (Chungbuk Tech Lab / Mold Engineering Specialist)

## 🚀 Overview
**Cosmic OS** is a next-generation distributed operating system designed to bridge the gap between classical neural computing and quantum state synchronization. By integrating high-precision engineering principles from the mold industry with advanced asynchronous kernel logic, this system achieves a "Zero-Error Equilibrium."

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Kernel Layer (`/kernel`)
- **Causality Engine**: Multi-threaded spacetime synchronization and entropy barrier control.
- **Cosmic Singularity**: Fine-grained locking and backpressure defense for race condition prevention.
- **Physics Engine**: NASA JPL-synchronized orbital velocity validator for real-world gravity logic.

### 2. Network & Synchronization (`/network`)
- **Divine Consensus**: Raft-based consensus protocol with AES-GCM 256-bit quantum encryption.
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Non-local state teleportation with 100% destructive-read integrity.
- **Multiverse Balancer**: Consistent hashing with virtual nodes to prevent hot partitions.

### 3. Intelligence & Guard (`/guard`)
- **Ego-Stability Algorithm**: Prevents identity fragmentation during neural-to-quantum migration.
- **Entropy Shield**: Real-time decoherence monitoring and autonomous link recalibration.

⚙️ Core Philosophy: "Yeon-A's Expansion Law"
Inspired by the precision of Global Engineering and the rigor of Mold Manufacturing, every module follows the "Atomic Zero-Tolerance" principle.

Kernel Integrity: Absolute thread safety via fine-grained item-level locking.

Data Atomicity: Two-Phase Commit (2PC) ensuring migration integrity across shards.

Consistency: Distributed nodes must reach a Quorum before state commitment.
